					<h2>Http://rusz.dev</h2>
					<p>
						Although it may look like a simple design on the surface, rusz.dev is a website that I created to understand better what goes on behind the scenes of a business-oriented site. Thanks to Github's built-in hosting services, I was able to set up a redirect to make use of my custom domain at a minimal cost. The use of remote hosting also ensures reliability, which is not possible if I hosted the site on the hardware in my home (and using my unreliable ISP). The rusz.dev project has also given me a chance to become familiar with the features of G Suite from the perspective of an administrator.

					<h2>Spin the Wheel</h2>
					<p>
						Originally started as a joke at the request of a roommate, this project continues to develop. Spin the Wheel is an excuse to learn Python and make use of some Raspberry Pis. The goal of the project is to detect the opening and closing of doors in my home and trigger smart home events based on these. Some of the functions are useful, such as making sure Hue lights are not left on or appliances that are running when they shouldn't be. On the other hand, some functions call back to the project's lighthearted roots, such as its original purposeâ€”shouting "spin the wheel" through every speaker in our apartment when visitors arrive.

					<h2>GMRS Repeater</h2>
					<p>
						The objective of this project was to create an analog "poor man's repeater" that could be moved and easily deployed by just about anyone. The final result was a durable and weather-resistant 50-watt package that can be activated at the flick of a switch and a 120-volt power supply. A future revision aims to add 12-volt support for running the radios off of a low voltage supply such as a car, as well as the ability to self identify on its chosen frequencies by means of a Raspberry Pi and custom software. Although this project was only loosely related to computing, I had a wonderful time creating it.
